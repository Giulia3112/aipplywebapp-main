## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Build Process
1. Vite reads your `.env.local` (or `.env.production`)
2. Compiles React code
3. Optimizes assets
4. Creates `dist` folder

### Deployment Process
1. Firebase CLI uploads `dist` folder
2. Firebase CDN distributes files globally
3. Your site is live instantly

### Environment Variables
- **Development:** `.env.local` (for `npm run dev`)
- **Production:** Same `.env.local` used during `npm run build`
- Variables must start with `VITE_` to be included in build

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "firebase: command not found"
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Issue: Build fails
```bash
# Delete and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: Blank page in production
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test locally: `npm run preview`
4. Rebuild and redeploy

### Issue: API calls fail
1. Verify Railway API is running
2. Check Railway URL in `.env.local`
3. Test API directly
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`

---

## 📊 After Deployment

### Monitor Your Site

**Firebase Console:** [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

## 🔄 Future Deployments

After initial setup, deploying updates is simple:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

That's it! This single command:
1. Builds your app
2. Deploys to Firebase
3. Makes changes live

---

## 🌐 Custom Domain (Optional)

Want to use `aipply.tech` instead of `aipply-website.web.app`?

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Hosting → Add custom domain
3. Follow verification steps
4. Add DNS records to your domain registrar
5. Wait for SSL provisioning (up to 24 hours)

   ```

3. **Monitor your Firebase usage regularly**

4. **Set up custom domain early** (DNS propagation takes time)

5. **Keep your Railway API and Supabase credentials secure**

6. **Use CI/CD for automatic deployments** (optional, template included)
