# ðŸ§ª Test Your Railway API

## Find Your API Endpoints

### Method 1: Check Railway Logs
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your AIpply API project
3. Click on "Deployments" or "Logs"
4. Look for startup logs that show available endpoints

### Method 2: Test Common Endpoints

Open a new terminal and try these commands (replace YOUR_RAILWAY_URL):

```bash
# Test health/status endpoint
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/health

# Or try root
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/

# Common API patterns
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/api
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/api/docs
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/docs
```

### Method 3: Check in Browser

Open these URLs in your browser:
- `https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/`
- `https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/docs` (if FastAPI)
- `https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL.up.railway.app/api`

## Common Endpoint Structures

### FastAPI:
```
GET  /
GET  /docs
GET  /health
POST /search
POST /api/search
```

### Express/Node.js:
```
GET  /
GET  /api/health
POST /api/search
```

### Flask/Python:
```
GET  /
GET  /health
POST /search
```

## What to Share

Once you find the working endpoints, share:
1. The base URL (e.g., `https://aipply-api.up.railway.app`)
2. The available endpoints (e.g., `/search`, `/api/search`, etc.)
3. Any API documentation you have

Then I'll update the `railwayApiClient.js` to match your exact API structure!
